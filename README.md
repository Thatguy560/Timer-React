# The Project

A simple timer application made with React. With this application you can set a timer in minutes and once you click start the timer will count down in real time until it reaches 0. Once started, you have the option to pause and resume the timer as well as resetting it. Once the timer hits 00:00:00, an alarm sound will be triggered to notify you that your time is up!
